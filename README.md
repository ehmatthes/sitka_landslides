Sitka Landslides
===

This is an exploration of the weather data related to landslides in the Sitka area. The goal is to identify a weather signature that can be used to predict impending landslides with reasonable accuracy. This prediction could be used to guide notifications, warnings, and evacuations.

On August 18, 2015 a massive landslide occurred on Harbor Mt, killing three people. We received about 2.5 inches of rain in about 6 hours. This, combined with moderately strong winds, led to the slide. Here's a graph showing the cumulative rainfall, wind speeds, and rise in Indian River for the morning of August 18:

I'm going to try to add plots associated with previous slides, and compare the weather signature of each event. I'll then look to see if there are similar signatures when no landslides occurred.
